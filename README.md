# fresh-grass-dew-drops

This is a personal goal -- to read one research paper, article, blogpost, or tutorial every morning, the biggest part of my CS (mostly AI) journey to understand abstract ideas, problems, and ongoing research very well. The goal is to learn daily, and find myself and figure out what the most important and interesting probems are for me to work on in the future.

This is a list of things that I though were good for me to read about, and a similarly created list will most likely be very different for you. So this should not be treated as a "list of fundamental, must-read papers". This is for me to keep a personal, retrospective track of my learning, and for others (maybe people whom I might work with in the future) to look at my interests, my learning curve, and what I've recently been up to.
